    <p>
    I am experienced in leveraging agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. 
    Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. 
    
    Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. 
    During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.
    When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, 
    and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.

            <h3> The beginning</h3>
            <p>
            This is where it all started. A friend of mine asked if it was not fun, in the context of old memories, to buy a new desktop PC. 
            Yes why not? It was so very nice to put a PC together again. I did a lot in the late 90's and early zero's. 
            But, in addition to assembling, this time I was also interested in the operation of software. 
            Actually, it is best to realize how complicated programs work and put together. 
            My interest was worked; I started experimenting with software code.
