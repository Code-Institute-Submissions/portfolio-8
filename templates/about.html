    I am experienced in leveraging agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. 
    Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. 
    
    Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. 
    During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.
    When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, 
    and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.
