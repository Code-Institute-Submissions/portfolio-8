 "description": "This is where it all started. A friend of mine asked if it was not fun, in the context of old memories, to buy a new desktop PC. 
            Yes why not? It was so very nice to put a PC together again. I did a lot in the late 90's and early zero's. 
            But, in addition to assembling, this time I was also interested in the operation of software. 
            Actually, it is best to realize how complicated programs work and put together. 
            My interest was worked; I started experimenting with software code."
